Hartree Fock (HF) is the simplest electronic structure method and serves as a foundation for other more complex and accurate approximations (so-called post-HF methods). The HF method attempts to approximate the wave function of a many-body system (which is otherwise an analytically intractable problem), which in turn allows us to obtain desired expecation values of the system, such as energy.

This simple python implementation should allow to better understand the inner workings of the HF algorithm and will in future be expanded by visualization to enhance comprehension.
